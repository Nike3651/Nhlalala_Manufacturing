Steel Company Website Design

I was tasked with the project of designing a website for a steel company located in Boksburg. For the specific company not a lot of jaascript was involved since the main purpose of the website is to display information in regards to how they are and what they do as well as infom clients on how to get in contact with them.

The Homescreen: 
Contains a carousel that rotates through some of the company's photos.
The following section contains cards that were implemented with bootstrap v5 that displays some of their most renown line of work and buttons that link you to that specific service.
The section thereafter tells the viewer more about the team that is responsible for helping them perform all the services and why you would want to make use of them.

The About Us Screen:
Here I simply displayed the details about the company for instance who established it, and when. Details on experience and what sets them apart from their compeditors.

Service(s):
For every service the same template is used where the specific serice name is located at the very top. Followed by an image that shows the client what it looks like.
Lastly a short description on all specifications are listed so the client knows exactly what they are capable of requesting when they get into contact.

The Contact Us Screen:
Here bootstrap was implemented once again to create a row with two columns in. In the first column there is a telephone number, address and email-address aswell as buttons for the client to get into contact directly or view the company address on google maps for easy navigation. The second column simply has a snippet of the company location and where it is located for those that would know the area.
